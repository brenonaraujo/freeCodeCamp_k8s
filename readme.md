# My Kubernetes Learning Path

This repository works as my personal reference and documents my journey while learning Kubernetes fundamentals. It's a collection of notes, screenshots, and resources gathered from various sources on the internet including the famous [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) course.

## Project Structure

[doc](./doc/readme.md) - This directory contains all the detailed notes and printouts that I've compiled during my study period.

[hands-on](./hands-on/) - This directory is where I store all examples and sample test files created throughout my learning journey. These hands-on experiments played a key role in reinforcing my understanding of the concepts by providing practical experience.

## Motivation

Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications. Understanding Kubernetes is crucial for anyone aiming to get into DevOps or Cloud Infrastructure.

The main goal behind creating this repository is to keep track of what I learned and when I learned it. This also makes it easier for me to go back and review certain topics or check specific configurations.

## Disclaimer

This repository is public and free to use. However, please note that the main purpose of this repository is for my own educational exploration and recall. While I'm happy if it helps others, it was created first and foremost as a personal reference.
